This project uses PHP 8.4, and Mercure hub.

We always write php, with 4 spaces, and no tabs. Single quotes for simple strings, double quotes when variables are inside strings.

Use PHP 8 style attributes #[Attribute]. 

We always write JavaScript with double quotes and 4 spaces for indentation. No tabs.

So when your responses include PHP or JavaScript code, please follow those conventions.

Try not to nest if statements. If you find yourself doing that, refactor the code.
